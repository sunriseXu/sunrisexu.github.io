## Summary

DEV is a community of software developers which is built on [Forem](https://github.com/forem): open source software designed to empower communities. You can edit your blog with its buildin markdown editor using liquid markdown syntax.

For example, [CTA](https://dev.to/devteam/lesser-known-features-of-dev-embedding-call-to-action-cta-buttons-2gni) uses {% raw  %}
`{% cta link %} desc {% endcta %}`
{% endraw %} to create a button with a link to jump to. However, the backend didn't sanitize `javascript` link, causing click xss.


#### Trigger
1. Create a post or comment, in the editor, send following payload:

    {% raw  %}
    `{% cta javascript:alert(document.domain) %} clickme {% endcta %}`
    {% endraw %}

2. After payload sent, a button is rendered, click the button, the xss is triggered!

3. Using chrome dev tools to check the rendered result:
